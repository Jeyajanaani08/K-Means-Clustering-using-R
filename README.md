# K-Means Clustering using R 

As part of my journey into coding and machine learning, I developed a short project in R to explore supervised machine learning algorithms. I created a custom dataset containing random review values and uploaded it into the code. The project focuses on clustering the reviews into distinct groups using a supervised learning approach.

After executing the code, it generates a CSV file named "review_with_cluster", which includes an additional column specifying the cluster number assigned to each review. This project helped me understand the fundamentals of data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and result interpretation in R.
